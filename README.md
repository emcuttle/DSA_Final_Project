# Exercise 6 – Validating Data Source URLs - Kubernetes Job

This Kubernetes Job performs validation of dataset URLs for my final project, SAR Wildfire Building Damage Detection Model. 
It prints the dataset URLs, extracts the filenames, and confirms that the inputs are correctly formatted.

To run the job in Nautilus:
```bash
kubectl apply -f exercise6_data_loading_job.yaml
```

**Special Note:** AI-assisted tools were used for code debugging and documentation drafting; all experiments and results were executed by the author.
